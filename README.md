# Self-Study Curriculum for Cybersecurity, AI, Embedded Systems, and More

## Introduction
This curriculum is designed for self-study, focusing on practical skills in cybersecurity, AI, embedded systems, software development, and more, without requiring a university degree. It covers key areas like Linux, Windows, pentesting, ethical hacking, AI, ML, DL, NLP, IoT, automation, DevOps, MLOps, systems programming, compiler design, robotics, web development, and operating systems design. The curriculum uses free or accessible resources, allowing you to learn independently while building a strong portfolio.

In this adjusted version, we integrate **Nim** more extensively due to its versatility—it compiles to JavaScript, C, and C++, supports inline assembly for C and C++, and provides multiple memory management options (ORC, ARC, and manual). We also introduce **Rust**, a modern systems programming language renowned for its safety and concurrency features, enhancing the curriculum’s depth in systems programming, embedded systems, and secure software development.
